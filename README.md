# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to prepare Pewlett-Hackard for the upcoming "Silver Tsunami". We are tasked with finding out how many of the employees are retiring as well as their positions, in order to best prepare for the loss and filling those positions efficiently. 

## Results 

* The main takeaway from the analysis is that 72,458 employees will be retiring in the near future. The retirement_titles.csv file has over 133,000 rows however that is partly due to the fac that some employees have changed roles during their time with the company.

* Another point to consider is that employees don't stay in the same position for the duration of their careers. This is important to note becuase there will be staff changes despite employees not retiring.

* Most of the soon to be retirees are at the senior level positions. It would be wise for management to monitor those positions since they are the most likely to retire and need replacement.

* Finally, the majority of retirees are in either the Engineer or Staff position. Management should focus on those departments accordingly when implementing their new hiring strategies.

## Summary

Management will need to fill 72,458 roles as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact and more employees are retiring. However, only 1,549 employees are currently eligible to be mentors in the program. As a result, there won't be enough mentors to take on the task of coaching the next generation of employees. An additional query that would help us better understand management's situation is one in which shows a breakdown of titles for the employees that are eligible for the mentorship program. In conclusion, management will have to pay close attention to those in senior positions and begin to promote employees at an earlier age.
